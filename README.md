### 🎯 Smart Decision Logic

**Underwriting Algorithm:**
- Credit score ≥ 700 + loan ≤ preapproved limit → **Auto Approve**
- Credit score ≥ 700 + loan ≤ 2× limit → **Request Salary Slip**
- Credit score < 700 or loan > 2× limit → **Reject**

**Learning Mechanism:**
- Dynamically adjusts approval threshold
- Based on last 20 successful applications
- Updates threshold = average credit score - 10
